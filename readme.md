# **Clay's Big Family**

This is my first solo api project as a student from Code Chrysalis. I created a database with some data pertaining to my family members to play around with.

**Current queries:**  
*member*: retrieve specified information on a family member  
*family*: retrieve specified information on the entire family  

Information that can be retrieved are:  
id  
first_name  
middle_name  
age  
birthday  
birthplace  
likes  
dislikes  

**Current mutations:**  
*addMember*: adds a new family member  
*deleteMember*: deletes a family member :(  
*updateMember*: updates information on a family member  

**To Do:**  
1. Define more types to mess around with other than integers and strings (arrays, objects)  
2. Create another database and link it to the family database (foreign keys)  
3. Add more queries (retrieving members under/over a certain age)  
4. Add more mutations
